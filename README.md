# alarm-to-eat
[Proyect done on Nov 2016]

AlarmToEath is an Arduino Prototype that helps people to manage eating times.

The notification is done using a Buzzer and showing on a LCD the time remaining.

There is a button that is used to reset the time once you are done eating.

The time determined to eat is limited by 2 LEDs, the Green LED is used to show that you can eat and the Red LED is used to show that the time has exceeded.
